<h1>The openAPE workflow model</h1>
<ol>
<li>A user personalizes a device according to his needs (e.g., font size, language etc.).</li>
<li>The device creates different context objects that contain the relevant user settings and for which context they were made. These contexts are uploaded to the corresponding context web services.</li>
<li>In a next step, the user can approach any other device connected to the openAPE infrastructure and can authenticate himself.</li>
<li>After the authentication, this second device uploads the current context conditions (equipment, environment and task context). </li>
<li>In a next step, it sends a request message to the listing service in order to obtain information about optimized UI settings and additional UI resources. Thereby it refers to the uploaded context information. </li>
<li>The listing service starts a matchmaking mechanism to infer the recommended UI settings and adaptations.</li>
<li>The listing service exposes the recommended settings to the client.</li>
<li>The client downloads the recommendations and adjusts its UI.</li>
<li>If mentioned in the recommendations, the device can download additional UI resources.</li>
<li>Optionally, the client gives feedback on the quality of the recommended settings to openAPE. </li>
