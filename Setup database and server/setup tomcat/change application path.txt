1. locate our .war file OUTSIDE of the usual deployment folder webapps to avoid double startup.
2. create an "openape.xml" file in the "tomcat/conf/Catalina/localhost" folder with the contensts:
<Context 
  docBase="<path/Application.war>" 
  path="/openape" 
  reloadable="true" 
/>
With "\" for "/" in the file path if you operate on windows.
